## **Data Preparation and Exploratory Data Analysis**

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- The process of exploring and visualizing data to find useful patterns and insights that help inform the modeling process.
- EDA lets you identify the most promising features from your model.
- It helps to uncover potential issues with the features or target that need to be addressed.

### **EDA** for **Regression**
- Target variable
- Fetaures
- Feature Target Relationship
- Feature Feature Relationship

### Exploring Target Variable
- Understand where most values lie (Mean, Median, and Mode)
- How spread out they are (Range, Variance, Standard Deviation)
- What shape? or Distribution?
- Outliers?
- Data Visualization (Histogram, Boxplot, Skewness)

### Exploring the Features
- Helps us to understand them and start to get a sense of the transformation we need to apply to each one.
- Histograms and boxplots (Numeric Features)
- **value_counts()** and bar charts (Categorical Features)
