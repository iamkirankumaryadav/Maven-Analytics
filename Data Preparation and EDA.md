## **Data Preparation and Exploratory Data Analysis**

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Exploring and visualizing data to find useful patterns and insights that help inform the modelling process.
- EDA lets you identify the most promising features of your model.
- It helps to uncover potential issues with the features or targets that need to be addressed.

### **EDA** for **Regression**
- Target variable
- Features
- Feature Target Relationship
- Feature Feature Relationship

### Exploring Target Variable
- Understand where most values lie (Mean, Median, and Mode)
- How spread out they are (Range, Variance, Standard Deviation)
- What shape? or Distribution?
- Outliers?
- Data Visualization (Histogram, Boxplot, Skewness)

### Exploring the Features
- Helps us understand them and start to understand the transformation we need to apply to each one.
- Histograms and boxplots (Numeric Features)
- **value_counts()** and bar charts (Categorical Features)

### Linear Relationships
- Numeric variables have linear relationships between them (positive, negative, no relationship)
- Positive relationship (One changes, other changes in same direction)
- Negative relationship (One changes, other changes in opposite direction)
- When one variable changes, so does the other
- These relationships can be visualized with scatterplots and heatmaps
