All about **Data Science**, **MLOps**, and **Business Intelligence**

### **Data Science**
**Data science** is about using data to make smart decisions.

What happened? | What's going to happen
:--- | :---
Descriptive Analytics | Predictive Analytics
Data Analysis | Data Mining
Business Intelligence | Data Science

Coding (Python) + Math (Statistics) + Domain Knowledge = Data Science

### **Machine Learning**
**Machine learning** uses algorithms applied by data scientists to enable computers to learn and make decisions from data.

### **Data Science Workflow**

1. Scoping a project
- Define scope
- Who are the end users or stakeholders?
- What business problems are you trying to help them solve?
- Is this a supervised or unsupervised learning problem?
- Do you even need Data Science?
- What data do you need for analysis?

2. Gathering data
- Gather the right data
- Flat file (Spreadsheets), Database, Website (Scrapping), API's

3. Cleaning data
- Clean data properly to produce accurate and reliable results
- 

4. Exploring data

5. Modelling data

6. Sharing insights | Making predictions
